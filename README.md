# learning-django

I like python. I like backend development. I like opinionated, batteries included frameworks.

So I decided to learn Django.

## Advanced Django APIs
From a udemy course.
* https://github.com/JYC11/recipe-api

## Ecommerce Website
Following another udemy course but I'm gonna make extensive changes to the codebase. I looked at the finished project but I do not like how the code is organized in django and how it uses JS for the frontend. Planning to rearchitect the backend, add tests(backend and frontend), refactor frontend in typescript and add a few more features(need to brainstorm)
* no repo yet

## Personal Project
* thinking of what to do...
* I'm switching focus to Nest.js so I may not do a personal project
